Welcome!

My name is Lorenzo and I'm a CS student. My primary interests are
programming languages, compiler construction, and C programming. I
like sunny days.

This website is
[open source](https://github.com/0xHaru/0xharu.github.io), and it's my
small effort to promote a minimal and decentralized web.
